# Hey Arduino!

The **Hey Arduino!** example triggers a LED matrix animation whenever the keyword "Hey Arduino" is detected through a microphone.

To use this example, we need to use **Network Mode**, as it requires a [USB-C® hub](https://store.arduino.cc/products/usb-c-to-hdmi-multiport-adapter-with-ethernet-and-usb-hub) (to connect the microphone).

Network mode is selected when launching the Arduino App Lab. You can read more about this the [Network Mode section](/learn/first-setup#option-2-remote-connect-ssh).

## Bricks Used

- `keyword_spotting` - this Brick is designed to detect sound patterns, triggering event in case of a match.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware

- Arduino® UNO Q or Arduino VENTUNO Q
- [USB-C® hub](https://store.arduino.cc/products/usb-c-to-hdmi-multiport-adapter-with-ethernet-and-usb-hub) _(only for UNO Q)_
- USB microphone (or headset)
- A power supply (5 V, 3 A) for the USB hub (e.g. a phone charger) _(only for UNO Q)_

### Software

- Arduino App Lab

## How to Use the Example

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect an USB-C® hub to the board
2. Connect a USB microphone or headset to the USB-C® hub.
3. Power the USB-C hub from a 5V power source (e.g. phone charger).

### Launch the App

1. Make sure we are connected to the board using the **Network mode** (selected when launching Arduino App Lab).
2. Launch the App by clicking on the "Play" button in the top right corner. Wait until the App has launched.

3. Say the words "Hey Arduino" into the microphone.
4. An animation on the LED matrix should trigger (heart animation).

### How it Works

This example uses the `keyword_spotting` Brick, which is designed to detect specified keywords. A pre-trained model is used particularly for identifying **"Hey Arduino"**.

The Brick monitors the audio continuously, and when it detects the keyword, it calls the microcontroller to activate an animation on the LED matrix, using the Bridge tool.

### Understanding the Code

On the Linux (Python) side:

- `spotter = KeywordSpotting()` - initializes an audio listener that monitors microphone input
- `spotter.on_detect("hey_arduino", on_keyword_detected)` - if "Hey Arduino" is detected, call the `on_keyword_detected()` function
- `Bridge.call("keyword_detected")` - inside the callback function, we use the Bridge tool to tell the microcontroller that the keyword has been spotted!

On the microcontroller (sketch) side:

- `Bridge.provide("keyword_detected", wake_up);` - we receive a call to "wake up" from the Python side.
- `playAnimation(HeartAnim, 8, 1, 50);` - plays an animation when the keyword is identified.
